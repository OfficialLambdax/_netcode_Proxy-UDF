# _netcode_Proxy-UDF
This is an Addon for the https://github.com/OfficialLambdax/_netcode_Core-UDF

The same describition of the Core UDF applies to here. This UDF is in its concept phase and alot of things are missing and subject to change. So DONT USE

It adds Proxy functionalities. Proxies need to be configured manually. It is not a entirely specific http/s proxy. It proxies every traffic to the said destination and vise versa. So the client connecting to the Proxy needs to tell the Proxy where to connect to, this can either be a Browser or any other application. However the UDF only comes with basic support for HTTP/S as of yet. Any other system like a SOCKS processor needs to be manually coded and the UDF is ment to be used in that configurable way.
